Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

## Best europe footbal stadiums


I like football a lot. And always is useful to have a guide of were best team' stadiums are. 
I let it here for who wants to see it!:

``` {r mapping}

library(leaflet)

footballIcon <- makeIcon(
        iconUrl <- "http://pngimg.com/uploads/football/football_PNG52797.png",
        iconWidth = 25*215/230, iconHeight = 25, iconAnchorX = 25*215/230/2, iconAnchorY = 12
)

mydf <- data.frame(StadiumName = c("Santiago Bernabeu", "Camp Nou","Giussepe Meazza","Parc des Princes",
                                   "Juventus Stadium","Signal Iduna Park","Allianz Arena","Old Trafford",
                                   "Stamford Bridge","Estadio do Dragão","Johan Cruijff Arena","Anfield"),
                   lat = c(40.4530541,41.38096,45.47808,48.841436,45.105666244,51.49260657816879,48.218679,53.463059,
                           51.475664764,41.161533355713,52.3143713,53.4308278),
                   long = c(3.6883445, 2.12283,9.124,2.253049,7.637997448,7.451777458190918,11.623765,-2.291340, 
                           -0.187999248,-8.5836696624756,4.9419641,-2.9608472),
                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
 



my_map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles()  %>% addMarkers(data = mydf, icon = footballIcon, lat=~lat, 
             lng=~long, popup=~StadiumName)
  my_map
```
